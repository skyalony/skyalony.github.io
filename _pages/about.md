I am a senior year undergraduate student from the [School of Economics, HUST](http://eco.hust.edu.cn/), where I major in Economic Statistics. I will be commencing my graduate studies at RUC. My research interests include labor economics, environmental economics, development economics, and corporate governance. I also have an occasional interest in statistics, particularly in areas related to causal inference questions.
